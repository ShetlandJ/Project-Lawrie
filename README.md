# Project Lawrie

Project Lawrie was a commissioned webscraper project for StepChange Debt Charity. It takes its name from the employee who would be using the app.

## App purpose

Lawrie wanted a simple website that could: 

- scrape URLs he had submitted 
- grab some content from those URLs 
- return it formatted in a way that he could easily distribute via email to his colleagues.

The app requires a very basic output screen, hence the lack of much styling. That may be changed in the future.

The code makes use of some excellent Ruby Gems such as `nokogiri` and `httparty` to aid with webscraping.
